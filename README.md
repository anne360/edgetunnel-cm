# edgetunnel
This is a script based on the CF Worker platform. It modifies the original version to display VLESS configuration information and convert it into subscription content. Using this script, you can easily convert VLESS configuration information to tools such as Clash or Singbox using online configuration.

## Risk Warning
- Avoid node configuration information leakage by submitting false node configuration to the subscription service.
- In addition, you can also choose to deploy [WorkerVless2sub Subscription Generation Service](https://github.com/cmliu/WorkerVless2sub) by yourself, so that you can take advantage of the convenience of the subscription generator.

## Workers deployment method [video tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeT4jQUh8ok&t=83s)

<details>
<summary><code><strong>「 Workers deployment text tutorial 」</strong></code></summary>

1. Deploy CF Worker:
- Create a new Worker in the CF Worker console.
- Paste the contents of [worker.js](https://github.com/cmliu/edgetunnel/blob/main/_worker.js) into the Worker editor.
- Change line 7 `userID` to your own **UUID**.

2. Access subscription content:
- Visit `https://[YOUR-WORKERS-URL]/[UUID]` to get subscription content.
- For example, `https://vless.google.workers.dev/90cd4a77-141a-43c9-991b-08263cfe9c10` is your universal adaptive subscription address.
- For example, `https://vless.google.workers.dev/90cd4a77-141a-43c9-991b-08263cfe9c10?sub` Base64 subscription format, suitable for PassWall, SSR+, etc.
- For example, `https://vless.google.workers.dev/90cd4a77-141a-43c9-991b-08263cfe9c10?clash` Clash subscription format, suitable for OpenClash, etc.
- For example, `https://vless.google.workers.dev/90cd4a77-141a-43c9-991b-08263cfe9c10?sb` singbox subscription format, suitable for singbox, etc.

3. Bind custom domains to workers:
- In the `Trigger` tab of the workers console, click `Add custom domain` below.
- Fill in the subdomain name you have transferred to the CF domain name resolution service, for example: `vless.google.com`, then click `Add custom domain` and wait for the certificate to take effect.
- **If you are a novice, you can take off now, no need to read on! ! ! **

4. Subscription content using your own `preferred domain name`/`preferred IP`:
- If you want to use your own preferred domain name or your own preferred IP, you can refer to the deployment instructions in the [WorkerVless2sub GitHub repository](https://github.com/cmliu/WorkerVless2sub) to build it yourself.
- Open the [worker.js](https://github.com/cmliu/edgetunnel/blob/main/_worker.js) file, find the `sub` variable in line 12, and modify it to the subscription generator address you deployed. For example, `let sub = 'sub.cmliussss.workers.dev';`, be careful not to include protocol information and symbols such as https.
- Note that if you use your own subscription address, the `sub` domain name of the subscription generator and the domain name of `[YOUR-WORKER-URL]` must not belong to the same top-level domain name, otherwise an exception will occur. You can assign the domain name assigned to workers.dev to the `sub` variable.

## Pages upload deployment method **Best recommendation!!!** [Video tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59THrmJhmAw)

<details>
<summary><code><strong>「 Pages upload file deployment text tutorial 」</strong></code></summary>

1. Deploy CF Pages:
- Download the [main.zip](https://github.com/cmliu/edgetunnel/archive/refs/heads/main.zip) file and click Star!!!
- After selecting `Upload assets` in the CF Pages console, name your project and click `Create Project`, then upload the downloaded [main.zip](https://github.com/cmliu/edgetunnel/archive/refs/heads/main.zip) file and click `Deploy site`.
- After the deployment is complete, click `Continue processing site`, select `Settings` > `Environment variables` > **Make** define variables for production environment > `Add variable`.
Fill in **UUID** for the variable name and your UUID for the value, then click `Save`.
- Return to the `Deployment` tab, click `Create new deployment` in the lower right corner, re-upload the [main.zip](https://github.com/cmliu/edgetunnel/archive/refs/heads/main.zip) file, and click `Save and deploy`.

2. Access subscription content:
- Visit `https://[YOUR-PAGES-URL]/[YOUR-UUID]` to get the subscription content.
- For example, `https://edgetunnel.pages.dev/90cd4a77-141a-43c9-991b-08263cfe9c10` is your universal adaptive subscription address.
- For example, `https://edgetunnel.pages.dev/90cd4a77-141a-43c9-991b-08263cfe9c10?sub` Base64 subscription format, suitable for PassWall, SSR+, etc.
- For example, `https://edgetunnel.pages.dev/90cd4a77-141a-43c9-991b-08263cfe9c10?clash` Clash subscription format, suitable for OpenClash, etc.
- For example, `https://edgetunnel.pages.dev/90cd4a77-141a-43c9-991b-08263cfe9c10?sb` singbox subscription format, suitable for singbox, etc.

3. Bind a CNAME custom domain to Pages: [Video tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeT4jQUh8ok&t=851s)
- In the `Custom Domains` tab of the Pages console, click `Set Custom Domain` at the bottom.
- Fill in your custom subdomain name, and be careful not to use your root domain name, for example:
If the domain name you are assigned is `fuck.cloudns.biz`, then add a custom domain and fill in `lizi.fuck.cloudns.biz`;
- According to the requirements of CF, your domain name DNS service provider will be returned. After adding the CNAME record `edgetunnel.pages.dev` of the custom domain `lizi`, click `Activate Domain`.
- **If you are a novice, then your pages can be directly launched after binding the `custom domain`, no need to read on! ! ! **

4. Subscriptions using your own `preferred domain name`/`preferred IP`:
- If you want to use your own preferred domain name or your own preferred IP, you can refer to the deployment instructions in the [WorkerVless2sub GitHub repository](https://github.com/cmliu/WorkerVless2sub) to build it yourself.
- In the `Settings` tab of the Pages console, select `Environment variables` > `Make` > `Edit variables` > `Add variable`;
- Set the variable name to `SUB`, and the corresponding value is the address of the subscription generator you deployed. For example, `sub.cmliussss.workers.dev`, and then click **Save**.
- Then in the `Deployment` tab of the Pages console, select `All deployments` > `Latest deployment rightmost ...` > `Retry deployment`, that's it.
- Note that if you use your own subscription address, the `SUB` domain name of the subscription generator and the domain name of `[YOUR-PAGES-URL]` must not belong to the same top-level domain name, otherwise an exception will occur. You can assign the domain name assigned to Pages.dev to the `SUB` variable.

**Note: Filling in `CFEMAIL` and `CFKEY` at the same time will enable the display of request usage, but it is not recommended! There is no need to give a Worker project such high permissions! You are at your own risk! ! ! **

## Practical tips

**The subscription deployed by this project can quickly change the preferred subscription generator by adding the `sub` key value! **
> For example, `https://edgetunnel.pages.dev/90cd4a77-141a-43c9-991b-08263cfe9c10` is your universal adaptive subscription address

- Quickly change the subscription address of the subscriber to `VLESS.fxxk.dedyn.io`

```url
https://edgetunnel.pages.dev/90cd4a77-141a-43c9-991b-08263cfe9c10?sub=VLESS.fxxk.dedyn.io
```

**The nodes deployed by this project can be accessed through the node PATH (path) method, use the specified `PROXYIP` or `SOCKS5`! ! ! **

- Example of specifying `PROXYIP`
```url
/proxyip=proxyip.fxxk.dedyn.io
/?proxyip=proxyip.fxxk.dedyn.io
/proxyip.fxxk.dedyn.io (only for domains starting with 'proxyip.')
```

- Example of specifying `SOCKS5`
```url
/socks5=user:password@127.0.0.1:1080
/?socks5=user:password@127.0.0.1:1080
/socks://dXNlcjpwYXNzd29yZA==@127.0.0.1:1080
/socks5://user:password@127.0.0.1:1080
```

**When your `ADDAPI` can be used as a `PROXYIP`, you can add `?proxyip=true` to the end of the `ADDAPI` variable, and then use the preferred IP itself as the `PROXYIP` when generating nodes**
- Specify `ADDAPI` as a `PROXYIP` example
```url
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cmliu/WorkerVless2sub/main/addressesapi.txt?proxyip=true
```
